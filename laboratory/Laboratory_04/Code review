Code review

Stage I
- rename functions and variables to more significant names
- replace magic numbers with static variables

Stage II
- refactor the solution by managing the product type using enums

Stage III
- refactor by simplifying the function, splitting it into multiple simpler ones
- apply SRP from SOLID

Stage IV
- getFinalProductPriceWithDiscount is still doing more than 1 thing 
(extra account discount should be moved to another method)
- manage the NEW product type discount as the other types
- rename the methods - they sound similar


Stage V (SOLID)
- getAccountDiscount depends on Marketing strategy. 
We should outsource it (DIP & DI)
